# Rose Gold Calculator

This project is a visually appealing calculator designed to mimic the behavior of basic Casio calculators. It includes functionalities for decimal calculations and the ability to toggle between light and rose gold themes.

## Features

- **Visual Design**: A rose gold aesthetic for a premium and modern look.
- **Decimal Calculations**: Supports precise calculations with decimal numbers.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between a rose gold theme and a light theme for user preference.
- **Casio-Inspired Behavior**: Designed to simulate the functionality and user experience of a basic Casio calculator.
- **Chain Calculations**: Implements a caching system that handles sequential calculations smoothly.

## Skills Demonstrated

- JavaScript
- Front-End Development
- Event Listener Coordination
- Modularization and Code Organization

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Event Listener Coordination**:
   - Managing the interaction between visual elements and event listeners was a key challenge.

2. **Cache System**:
   - Implemented a mechanism to handle chain calculations effectively, ensuring smooth operation for users.

3. **Code Modularization**:
   - Learned the importance of organizing and modularizing code, especially in a flexible language like JavaScript.
